# Micro-Movement 
Gray Area Festival 2025 

This class will introduce the basics of microcontrollers and building
tools to translate movement into electronic expression. Students will
be introduced to the basics of CircuitPython and learn to program an
Adafruit Qt Py, accelerometer, and Bicolor LEDs. We'll explore
hardware in an accessible and approachable way, using these boards
to build out a basic interactive piece that participants can use to
visualize their movement.

Example code in this folder includes all libraries required to run. This sample code runs on [CircuitPython 9.2.8](https://circuitpython.org).

## Hardware Required

- Adafruit QTPY RP2040 
- Adafruit LIS3DH Accelerometer 
- Adafruit 8x8 Bicolor LED Matrix 
- STEMMA Qwiic Connect Cables 

All hardware has been sourced from Adafruit.

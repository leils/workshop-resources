# Micro-Movement 
Gray Area Festival 2025 

This class will introduce the basics of microcontrollers and building
tools to translate movement into electronic expression. Students will
be introduced to the basics of CircuitPython and learn to program an
Adafruit Qt Py, accelerometer, and Neopixel LEDs. We'll explore
hardware in an accessible and approachable way, using these boards
to build out a basic interactive piece that participants can use to
visualize their movement.
